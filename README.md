# Public-Sandbox
Random projects I feel comfortable sharing publicly.

## Active Projects
_(Italicized projects have not yet been started)_
- ### Console Ascii Graphics Engine (CAGE)
  A basic engine for creating simple graphics on any system using only characters. Using simple draw functions and char-loaded strings, you can easily produce text-based images for a system you can't access the individual pixels for!
  
- ### _Connectable_
  A barebones system for creating wire-pin-node connection systems like those used in Unreal Engine Blueprints, Unity Shader Graphs, Substance Designer Graphs, and so on. I realize this is a groundwork that has been made many times before, but I just like making things to see if I can figure out how they work.
  
- ### _Language Builder_
  Languages are made of small units called phonemes. Phonemes are combined using language-specific rules. Computers are very good at following rules. Instead of generating meaningless jumbles of letters, this program strives to produce rule-abiding words that, while in no existing dictionary, could very much be pronounced and given meaning.
  Potentially, I'd like to see if this program could be made to produce almost-coherant sentences using entirely made-up words which are attributed internal meanings and context rules. Maybe it could be used for creating alien conversations...
  
- ### _Self-Editing Script_
  I've always wondered why AI uses pre-defined actions & inputs with nodes given random, adjustable weights. It certainly works, but... What if the source code itself could be rewritten and not just how heavily pathways are relied upon? Well, this is a good way to figure that out, I think.
  Inspired by my very limited understanding of assembly code, this program has its own script language using 3-character instructions followed by either literal numbers or register indexes (technically also numbers). Since the instructions can be chosen randomly from a list, and random numbers are even a step easier to generate than that, every part of the script can be procedurally generated without fear of semantic/contextual errors, and with syntax errors being trivial to avoid.
  Split into two parts, the program has the power to both procedurally generate & evaluate this script language to any specified number of lines. Sure, it'll probably do next to nothing, but this program is only made to be the infinite monkeys with typewriters. I have yet to find a reliable method of pruning the giberish monkeys.
